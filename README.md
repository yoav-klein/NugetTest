# NugetTest

This little C# Project was created in order to exprience <br>
with Nuget Restore. <br>

The main function uses the `Newtonsoft` package, which is available at `nuget.org`. <br>

I used this repo in a Azure Pipelines pipeline which clones the repo, <br>
restores the package, and builds the solution.
